## Squarespace path

Use the design as a visual blueprint in Squarespace 7.1. Create Home and Projects pages, add the generated art as image blocks, and copy the text section by section. The custom CSS can be adapted in Design > Custom CSS. Squarespace is the easier choice if nontechnical editing is the priority.

## Droplet path

This folder can be served directly by Nginx with no build step. Point `broadwaypixels.com` and `www.broadwaypixels.com` to the droplet, copy the folder to `/var/www/broadwaypixels`, configure Nginx with `index index.html`, and add HTTPS with Certbot.

The contact email is `Media@BroadwayPixels.com`. Before launch, confirm project status language, final domain DNS, analytics, privacy copy, and social preview image.

## Art prompt

Built-in image generation was used for a wide editorial cartoon city connecting an aquarium game, barcode resale utility, and mobile storefront. The visual direction uses cobalt blue, powder blue, navy, off-white, and one warm yellow accent with no embedded text or logos.
