# Broadway Pixels website concept

Broadway Pixels website, positioning the studio as a music producer, content creator, and app developer. The site includes a project-aware support form backed by Resend.

## Squarespace path

Use the design as a visual blueprint in Squarespace 7.1. Create Home, Projects, Music, and Support pages, add the generated art as image blocks, and copy the text section by section. The custom CSS can be adapted in Design > Custom CSS. Keep the Resend API endpoint on a server or serverless host because Squarespace browser code must not contain the secret key.

## Droplet path

The support form needs a server endpoint, so run `server.mjs` behind Nginx instead of serving the folder directly. Copy `.env.example` to a protected environment file, add the Resend values, run the Node process with systemd, and proxy Nginx to `127.0.0.1:8080`. Add HTTPS with Certbot.

## Resend setup

1. Add and verify a sending subdomain such as `mail.broadwaypixels.com` in Resend.
2. Create a sending-only API key restricted to that domain.
3. Set `RESEND_API_KEY`, `SUPPORT_FROM_EMAIL`, `SUPPORT_TO_EMAIL`, and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` from `.env.example` in the hosting environment.
4. Run `npm test`, then start the site with `npm start`.

The API key must only exist on the server. Never add the real key to `support.js`, HTML, Git, or Squarespace code injection. If the frontend remains on Squarespace, deploy `/api/support` separately and change the form fetch URL in `support.js` to that HTTPS endpoint.

The contact email is `Media@BroadwayPixels.com`. Before launch, confirm project status language, final domain DNS, analytics, privacy copy, and social preview image.

## Art prompt

Built-in image generation was used for a wide editorial cartoon city connecting an aquarium game, barcode resale utility, and mobile storefront. The visual direction uses cobalt blue, powder blue, navy, off-white, and one warm yellow accent with no embedded text or logos.
